**Euler's totient function:**   
    - **Euler's totient function**, also known as phi-function ϕ(n), counts the number of integers between 1 and n inclusive, which are coprime to n. Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals 1 (1 is considered to be coprime to any number).  
    - **Divisor sum property:** ∑d|nϕ(d)=n    , here the sum is over all positive divisors d of n.
    - **Euler's theorem:**  aϕ(m)≡1(modm),   if a and m are relatively prime.
    - When m is prime, Euler's theorem turns into **Fermat's little theorem**:  am−1≡1(modm),   
    - Euler's theorem and Euler's totient function are used to compute the modular multiplicative inverse.
